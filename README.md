Amazon.com Landing page clone with HTML and CSS
In this project, I successfully cloned the landing page of Amazon.com using HTML and CSS. The goal was to recreate the familiar and user-friendly layout of the popular e-commerce website while ensuring responsiveness across different devices. Utilizing my web development skills, I meticulously designed the page to resemble the original Amazon.com landing page, giving users an immersive and authentic experience.
At the top of the page, I recreated the Amazon logo, ensuring its accurate positioning and dimensions. The navigation bar contains the same links as the original site, such as "Today's Deals," "Best Sellers," "Prime," and more. Using CSS, I implemented a dropdown menu for "Shop by Category," providing seamless navigation just like the real Amazon website.
The hero section was a critical component to get right, as it is the first thing users see when they land on the page. I meticulously copied the carousel that showcases popular products, ensuring smooth transitions between images and incorporating clickable buttons for navigation. The search bar, with its iconic yellow border, was recreated using HTML and CSS, allowing users to search for products with ease.
 I successfully cloned the landing page of Amazon.com using HTML and CSS, replicating the essential elements and features of the original website.

This project challenged my web development skills and allowed me to gain valuable insights into building user-friendly and visually appealing web pages.
